# Eye-Exercise
# Description: This program is an animation. When the program is ran, the eye graphic in the middle follows your mouse wherever it goes on the window. 
# How To Run: After opening the program, simply move the mouse around the screen and watch the eye follow.
# Future Improvements: For some reason the javascript file didn't get linked into the html file so I have to debug that. I also want to add another eye so its a pair of eyes following the mouse.
